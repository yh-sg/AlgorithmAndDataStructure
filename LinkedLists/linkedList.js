//?What is a linked list?

//DS that contains a head, tail and length property
//LL consit of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

//LL(Think of it like a staircase/elevator) vs Array
//Do not have indexes! | Indexed in order!
//Connected via nodes with a next pointer | Insertion and deletion can be exp(Due to changes of index)
//Random access is not allowed | Can Quickly be accessed at a specific index

/*========================================================================================================*/

// peice of data - val
// reference to next node - next

class Node{
    constructor(val){
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
