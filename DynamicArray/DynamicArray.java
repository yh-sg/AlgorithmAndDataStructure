//The dynamic array can grow and shrink in size.

//?How to implement it?
//*Use static array!
//1. Create a static array with an initial capacity

//2. Add elements to the underlying static array, keeping track of the number of elements.

//3. If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new static array with twice
//the capacity and copy the original elements into it.
